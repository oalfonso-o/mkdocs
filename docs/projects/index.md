# Projects

Here I'll write about some personal side-projects

* [Crossbox](crossbox.md):
Django webapp with Stripe payments that scaled a gym business from 30 users
up to 500 users in matter of months automating all the manual work of handling
the group sessions, the reservations, the payments, etc. Now the bottleneck of the growth of this business is the physical space, is not the technology anymore. Once the gym owner rents a bigger space this app will allow him to scale without modifications.

* [Balaland](balaland.md):
PyGame 2D shooter game that tries to emulate what would be to play a 3D 1st person shooter in case of being played from a 2D view like in GTA2. Balaland respects the angle of view like if the camera was set from a 3D 1st person point of view, that means if you don't peak a corner you will see black everything that's behind a wall. Using ray casting to achieve that. Also some basic AI for the enemies to make them a bit competitive.
Still work in progress.

* [Candlebot](candlebot.md):
Experimental backtesting app to gather historical market crypto prices from multiple CEX sources like Binance, define custom investing strategies based on indicators and run these parametrized strategies to backtest them against the historical prices fluctations and extract statistics of success. Interesting a fun project but nothing profitable at all.
